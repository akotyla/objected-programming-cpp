# object-oriented-programming-cpp
Projects from the Object Oriented Programming C++ Lecture, winter semester 2020. 
The first project is a cookbook program which uses my own implementation of dynamic array. 

The second one is an upgrade of the first one, namely a book of cookbooks. 
We were allowed to use c++ libraries, so i used vector class instead of mentioned before implementation of dynamic array. I also used function templates.
